# Contributing

Code contributions are welcome, be it bug-fixes or feature additions.

## Guidelines
Please try as much as posible to adhere to these:
- Code should be well formatted.
  - Conventions are not rules.
  - You can go against conventions whenever that results in better code readability or performance.
  - As for code line length, anything not above 90 characters is good.
- NAMES tell WHAT... CODE tell HOW... COMMENTS tell WHY, when neccessary (and maybe WHAT when impractical to make it obvious by NAMES).
- Use the same docstring format used in this project. Makes things unified.
- Test your changes or additions well enough before opening a pull request.
  - Possibly modify or add to the existing tests.
