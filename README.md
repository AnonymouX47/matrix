# matrix

A python library for matrix operations and manipulations.

## Back-Story

I had just completed my "Journey through the Docs", finished studying the Python aspect of the Python Docs (majorly the Library & Language Reference, wherewver else those referred me to and whatever else i needed to fully understand) with interactive sessions, testing things out.

Then i needed something to put to (real) practice all the things i had learned.
I wanted something purely **Standard** Python, no 3rd-party libraries and seemed this project would be a good place to start.

The project was actually concieved in the course of my "Journey through the Docs" but only stayed on my TODO list till after.

It's been interesting so far and the project actually turned out to incoparate a lot of what i learned. Though, definitely not all. :smile:

**NOTE:** This project is not intended to be a "re-invention of any wheel", it's basically just me practicing.
I actually made sure i didn't test out or go through any other similar project, at least, till i had implemented all I originally planned to.
